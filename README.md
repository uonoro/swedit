# swedit - simple web editor

Started as a first experiment using

- Tauri
- React/Typescript/Vite
- PrimeReact Components

Idea is to modify static html sites in a simple way by fetching files using a ftp client. Offering plain code editor at first. Second step will be a wysiwyg feature to ease editing for non-devs as well.
